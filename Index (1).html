<h1>BIO:</h1>
<p style="border: 2px solid #000; padding: 15px; background-color: #f0f0f0; border-radius: 8px; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
    I am someone who will always try and find the best solution in the most difficult situations. I value and work well in a well-functioning team. I believe 
    it takes everyone doing their part to complete a task effectively.
    I am always willing to learn and adapt to compromised situations in order to rise to the occasion.
</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
    My passions are exercising, going out with friends, playing video games, and engaging with
    different media, some that I am familiar with and others that interest me (e.g., Anime, NBA, comics).
    What drives me is living my life to the fullest without regrets and making the most of what I have
    and the time I have in order to be as successful as I can be.
</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
    What I most would like to do is see my goals of being an actor, radio host, or investor
    all realized in my lifetime. I would like to do what I want when I want without having to
    worry about monetary value. I know something like this won't fall into my lap, so I want to work 
    as hard as possible to see my dreams fulfilled.
